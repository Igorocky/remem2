- make it possible to add new languages and edit existing ones
- make bucket counts configurable
- implement moving cards to a folder (possibly in the ui)
- implement showing lists of cards:
    * all in a folder
    * last added
    * last repeated
    * containing text
- add new task type: fill gaps reversed
- implement stub cards and plugins

Done:
- fix the bug when history is not saved for a task
- fix a bug: it is not possible to quit the parameters view when there are no active cards
- print full name of the selected command
